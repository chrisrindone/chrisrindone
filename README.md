Experimenting!

This is an experimental project using w3.css. I'm not much into CSS frameworks, but this one had some stuff I was looking for out-of-the-box, and it's really easy to override.

It's also an exercise in responsive design and playing around with CSS Grid.

Feel free to explore, play and comment!
