            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h3>I'm Chris. Jack of Many Trades, Master of a Few</h3>
            <p>I've always had a keen interest in technology. Problem is, I have a very short attention span, and tend to learn things differently than most people. As a result I always try to simplify things and look for the shortest/easiest path to answers.</p>
            <p>For example, when I was working for a broadcast group in the northeast, I walked into a situation where a group of engineers and IT guys were trying to isolate a single machine in a server room. There were a bunch of Windows machines on a KVM switch and these guys were going nuts trying to figure out which was the one on the monitor. They already had one fellow starting to trace through a maze of wires. Not very efficient. I asked what they were doing. They explained. I asked if I could give it a try.</p>
            <p>I opened My Computer, right clicked on the CD-ROM drive, and clicked Eject. Lo and behold, out slid the tray on the offending PC. They were all muttering WTF. They were overthinking the problem, rather than going to - what I felt - was the simplest, most obvious solution. That's how I try to approach everything.</p>
            <p>For most of my working life I've been in radio broadcasting. The Great Recession broke me of that in 2009, so now I earn my paycheck cooking and managing a restaurant kitchen.</p>
            <p>As a side job - and when times are lean - I build websites. My current portfolio consists of the four WordPress websites belonging to the restaurant group I work for. Nothing fancy, but they do help provide for a few extra niceties.</p>
            <p>My goal is to transition from cooking full time to doing front-end development. It's a long road, but I'm determined to make it happen.</p>
            <p>I grew up in New England, and have been fortunate to live all over the USA. For the past twelve years I've made my home in New Orleans with the love of my life, Jane.</p>
